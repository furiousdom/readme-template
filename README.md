## About The Project

![Dom's Readme Template Screen Shot](../static-assets/screenshot.png)

This is a README project template meant to be a starting point so I can easily deal with starting a new project.
As I need to work on projects with different technology stacks I will create more README files that are basically the same but different in key parts. The plan is to store these different README's in different branches and name those branches accordingly.

Most of the text on this particular README is here to show off how the fully populated README file looks like.

I will make all README's in this repository fit my preferences but the BLANK_README in the master branch is free of any predefined setups so that anyone can use it. Just follow the instructions in the comments and it you can modify it in no time.

Happy coding :)
