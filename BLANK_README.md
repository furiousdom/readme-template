*** To avoid retyping too much info. Do a search and replace for the following:
*** user_name, repo_name, Project_Title, Short description.,
*** detailed project description text, logo_name, screenshot_name, COMPANY_NAME
-->

<!--  There are a few todo's so take care of each one -->

<!--
*** To upload screenshots, one way is:
*** Create a branch named "static-assets" by running:
***    > git checkout --orphan static-assets
*** The --orphan flag creates a new branch but without any prior commits.
*** However it does still keep the working tree and index.
*** So delete those files by running (watchout for the dot at the end):
***    > git rm -rf .
*** Add and commit the static files:
***    > git add screenshot.png demo.gif logo.png
***    > git commit -m "Added Assets"
*** Push the branch to remote:
***    > git push origin static-assets
*** Name all future commit as "Updated Assets"
*** To display the picture, in the README, type:
*** ![Alt Text](../static-assets/screenshot_name.png?raw=true)
